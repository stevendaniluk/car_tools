# car_tools
Collection of software, configuration files, and various other things related to my cars.

Each vehicle has its own directory. Anything that can be shared between vehicles is under the `common` directory.

*Tip:* To clone with submodules included run:
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:stevendaniluk/car_tools.git
```
